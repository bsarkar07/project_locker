The monthly data used here shows the prices of the equity stocks on the
first of every month, like,
2005-01-01 ...
2005-02-01 ...
2005-03-01 ...
etc.

The returns data that I am deriving from the price data, is based over the price on
the first of one month to the price on the first of the next month.
For eg:
2005-01-01 --- 100
2005-02-01 --- 120
Thus the return over first month, 2005-01-01 is 20%.
